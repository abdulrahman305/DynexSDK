## Supplementary Material

To ensure reproducibility and facilitate further research in this area, we have made our complete codebase publicly available. The implementation includes our RCS protocol setup, patch-based XEB verification methods, and analysis tools. Researchers can access the code through our GitHub repository. The repository contains detailed documentation, example configurations, and scripts to replicate both our 4 × 4 and 10 × 10 grid experiments. We encourage the quantum computing community to build upon this foundation and extend these benchmarking techniques to other quantum platforms and architectures.
