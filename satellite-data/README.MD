# Quantum Satellite Placement

This quantum algorithm explores the problem of optimally grouping a set of satellites into constellations to observe specific targets on Earth. Each satellite has unique observational capabilities, influencing how effectively it can monitor a designated area for a certain duration. The goal of the algorithm is to demonstrate quantum superiority on how to maximize the Earth coverage of each constellation, ensuring that all targets are monitored as efficiently as possible.
