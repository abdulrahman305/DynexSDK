Dynex SDK Software Documentation
================================

Dynex is the worldâ€™s first neuromorphic supercomputing blockchain based on the DynexSolve chip algorithm, a Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) \ 
approach to solving real-world problems. The Dynex SDK is used to interact and compute on the Dynex Platform. All examples require the \ 
DynexSDK for Python as well as a valid API key. 

* :ref:`gs` shows how to install and begin using the Dynex SDK.

* :ref:`concepts_sdk` defines and describes Ocean concepts and terminology.
