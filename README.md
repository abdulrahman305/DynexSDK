# DynexSDK
Dynex is the worldâ€™s first neuromorphic supercomputing blockchain based on the DynexSolve chip algorithm, a Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) approach to solving real-world problems. The Dynex SDK is used to interact and compute on the Dynex Platform.

# Beginners Guide

The following examples require the DynexSDK for Python as well as a valid API key:
